The goal of this was to create an immeserive, fun, and interactive aquatic environment for users to learn a bit about our oceans. Be it the good and the bad, the project teaches users all the ocean has to offer be it its expansive aquatic life, to threats to the ocean itself like oil spills and pollution.
